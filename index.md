## Black box testing React components connected to Redux

Whats the better way to make your code more maintainable and easier to change in the future than writing tests?
Probably hiring a bunch of interns to test code manually after each commit, but we don't have time and money for that so tests will have to do.

In this post I will focus on the importance of black box testing and how this can be achieved  in React.
I will be using jest, react-testing-liblary and Typescript for my own sanity.
I am also gonna assume that you know the basics of these technologies.
